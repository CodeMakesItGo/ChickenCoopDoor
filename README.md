# ChickenCoopDoor
Chick Coop Automated Smart Door

This project uses an Arduino Nano.

For this project we built a chicken coop door that is operated by a smart phone app. 
This allows you to monitor your chicken coop door remotely, open and close it remotely, set a schedule for operation, and operate it using Amazon Alexa.
